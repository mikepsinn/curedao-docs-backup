# PHP Developer

You are comfortable at all points in the typical PHP/MySQL/Nginx stack. You are a builder and API fanatic. You have a full understanding of all major authentication and authorization schemes.

Primary Goal: Help CureDAO to acquire, integrate, and normalize heterogeneous data from even more of the most popular life-tracking devices and services.\
Establish a research commons to anonymously pool data in stratified user groups and share discoveries.

Approach:

You will build screen scrapers, spreadsheet upload/import modules, and connector modules to pull data from existing third-party APIs.

Impact:

An increase in the quantity of data will produce a proportional increase in the number of clinical discoveries made.
