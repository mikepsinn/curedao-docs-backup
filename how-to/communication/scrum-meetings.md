# ðŸ“˜ Scrum Meetings

## SCRUM AGENDA

The daily scrum meeting is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues raised are taken offline and usually dealt with by the relevant subgroup immediately after the meeting.

During the daily scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:

1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What will you do today?
3. Are there any impediments in your way?

By focusing on what each person accomplished yesterday and will achieve today, the team gains an excellent understanding of what work has been done and what work remains. The daily scrum meeting is not a status update meeting in which a boss is collecting information about who is behind schedule. Instead, it is a meeting in which team members make commitments to each other.

## SCRUM MASTER

It requires discipline and assertiveness to be a SCRUM master. If the meeting goes over time and everyone hasn't shared their thoughts, the current SCRUM gets a notice. If this happens 2 times, we look for another SCRUM master.

## SCHEDULING

It's essential for everyone to attend so, please indicate your daily availability at [https://www.when2meet.com/?14594036-Akl3N](https://www.when2meet.com/?14594036-Akl3N) so we can find the best time.
