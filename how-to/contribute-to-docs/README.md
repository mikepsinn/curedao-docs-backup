## Other Options

### Editing Directly on GitHub

**(recommended for beginners or small changes)**

The fastest way is to edit directly on GitHub.

Each page has an "Edit on GitHub" link to the right of the content. By clicking it you are taken to the GitHub sign-in page, where you can either log in or create an account.

Once logged in, you'll be taken to the GitHub built-in text editor where you can make your edits directly. When you've completed your changes, you can add any specific details on what was changed create a new Pull Request to the repository. From there one of the maintainers will review your changes, and either merge them or request changes.

Remember that after you click "Propose Changes", you must also click on "Create Pull Request" on the next page.

The process is illustrated in this [visual walk-through](https://scribehow.com/shared/How\_to\_Write\_a\_Constitution\_In\_a\_Democratic\_Fashion\_\_XPpT\_GzCQC27ouEjEF2oXg).

1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing `MarkDown` style, language, and layout.
2. Please adhere to the guidelines in the [Writing Style Guide](style-guide.md).
3. **Commit messages should be as detailed as possible to describe the changes made.**

1. Click the `Fork` button to create your own copy of this repository.
2. Press the `.` character while browsing YOUR FORKED repository or pull request on GitHub.
3. Edit in VS Code
